Hi, I'm @epitcher! ðŸ¦• 

I'm a professional code monkey who loves to dig into cutting-edge technology stacks and innovative projects. Currently, I'm trying to get up to proficient level in Rust, enjoying container-ising everything, and my current go-to is Python.

As a developer recently I've been paid to write PHP (mostly Symfony-based), VueJS and strict ECMAScript 3 for prop systems in addition to maintaining EOL AngularJS. I'm also head-babysitter of a B2B services website which, in my time of managing it, has grown over 30,000 users ðŸš€

Currently, much of my work is focused on DevOps, handling deployment projects, planning deployment lifecycles, tech stack modernization and resolving the issues which are brought forward by other developers.

ðŸ’¡ Always excited to collaborate on projects where I can make a positive impact. If you'd like to chat about potential opportunities, feel free to reach out at `epitcher at duck dot com` (bots, please don't bother, unless I can't tell you're a bot - in that case, it's fair game, I guess)
