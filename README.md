Hi, I'm @epitcher! ðŸ¦• 

I'm a professional code monkey who loves to dig into cutting-edge technology stacks and innovative projects. Currently, I'm trying to get up to proficient level in Rust, enjoying container-ising everything, and my current go-to is Python.

As a developer, I've been paid to write PHP (mostly Symfony-based), VueJS, AngularJS (oh no no no, it's EOL, that isn't good) and strict ECMAScript 3 for prop systems.

ðŸš€ Collaborating on projects that make a positive impact always excites me. If you'd like to chat about potential opportunities, feel free to reach out at `epitcher at duck dot com` (bots, please don't bother, unless I can't tell you're a bot - in that case, it's fair game, I guess)
